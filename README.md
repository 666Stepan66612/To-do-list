# To-Do List Application

A microservices-based task management application with JWT authentication, event logging via Kafka, and modern web interface.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/666Stepan66612/To-do-list.git
cd To-do-list

# Start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Access the app
# Web UI: http://localhost:8080
# API: http://localhost:8081
```

## 📋 Features

- ✅ **User Authentication** - JWT-based auth with bcrypt password hashing
- 📝 **Task Management** - Create, complete, delete tasks with descriptions
- 🔒 **User Isolation** - Each user sees only their own tasks
- 📊 **Event Logging** - All actions logged to Kafka with user information
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Responsive web interface with auth screens
- 🔍 **Task Filtering** - View all, active, or completed tasks

## 🏗️ Architecture

**7 Microservices:**
- **Frontend** (nginx) - Web UI on port 8080
- **API Service** (Go) - REST API with JWT auth on port 8081
- **DB Service** (Go) - Database operations (internal)
- **PostgreSQL** - User and task storage
- **Kafka + Zookeeper** - Event streaming
- **Kafka Service** (Go) - Event consumer and logger

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Go 1.25, PostgreSQL 15, Kafka 7.5, JWT, Bcrypt
- **Frontend:** HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, Nginx
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Authentication
```http
POST /register   # Register new user
POST /login      # Login user
```

### Tasks (Require JWT Token)
```http
GET    /tasks         # Get all user tasks
POST   /create        # Create new task
POST   /complete/{id} # Mark task complete
DELETE /delete/{id}   # Delete task
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- Bcrypt password hashing (cost factor 12)
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiry
- User-specific task isolation
- Complete audit trail with user information
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries

## 📊 Event Logging

All operations logged to `logs/events.log`:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-04T13:35:31Z",
  "user_id": 3,
  "username": "MrKhm",
  "action": "DELETE_TASK",
  "details": "Task deleted: id=3",
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

## ⚠️ Production Notes

Before deploying to production:
1. Change JWT secret in `apiservice/auth/auth.go`
2. Change database password in `docker-compose.yaml`
3. Update API URL in `frontend/index.html`
4. Enable HTTPS with reverse proxy
5. Set up monitoring for event logs
